DESCRIPTION:  This Project is a very powerfull and flexible tool for editing , converting , and enhancing graphic images quality. This is a unique tool of its kind available with full source code in vb. The basic idea is to use plugins for doing virtually every task involved in the project.This project currently uses 5 types of plugins:

1)Filters	-	For Adding Effects To Images.
2)Encoders	-	For Encoding Images To Other Format (eg. BMP to JPG).
3)Decoders	-	For Decoding And Loading Various Image Formats.
4)ToolBox	-	For Adding New ToolBoxes To Project For Various Purpose.
5)MenuBar	-	Addes New Menus To Project.

ToolBox And MenuBars Are Currently NOT IMPLEMENTED Because Of Some Known Limitations But You Will See Them Soon.

This project is SMART enough to distinguish between different plugins even they use same extension and structure to get the work done.
